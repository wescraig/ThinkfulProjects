# Thinkful Projects
Small projects I've completed from Thinkful.com tutorials.

1) Meal Calculator:
Instantiate diner objects, add meals to their list, and split the total bill including tax and tip. This is just some extra JavaScript practice using the Cloud9 remote IDE. 

2) Shopping-List:
RESTful API to add, delete, and edit a basic shopping list.
